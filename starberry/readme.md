> Small, sweet, easy framework for full-stack Rust web applications

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Starberry is a lightweight, intuitive web framework focused on simplicity and productivity. It supports regex-based routing, tree-structured URLs, and integrates seamlessly with the Akari templating system.

**[Example project](https://github.com/Field-of-Dreams-Studio/starberry-example/tree/main)**

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Simple API**: Intuitive request/response handling with minimal boilerplate
- **Full-Stack**: Built-in template rendering with Akari templates
- **Flexible Routing**: Support for regex patterns, literal URLs, and nested routes
- **Asynchronous**: Built with Tokio for efficient async handling
- **Form Handling**: Easy processing of form data and file uploads
- **Middleware Support**: Create reusable request processing chains 
- **Multi-Protocal Support**: Starberry is now planning to handle ingoing or outgoing http(s), db and other tcp protocals

### Multi Protocol and new App Mechanism

    RX1[Get Connection from TcpListener]
    RX2{Multiple Protocol Mode?}
    RX3["Test each protocol with Rx::test()"]
    RX4[Select first protocol returning true]
    RX5[Use that protocol type]
    RX6[Use the single protocol directly]
    RX7[Process request: read/write as needed]
    TX1[Build Tx and Connection]
    TX2["Tx::send(): send Response, get Request"]
    TX3{Is connection needed?}
    TX4[Close connection]
    TX5[Keep connection open]

    RX1 --> RX2
    RX2 -- Yes --> RX3
    RX3 --> RX4
    RX4 --> RX5
    RX5 --> RX7
    RX2 -- No --> RX6
    RX6 --> RX7
    RX7 --////--> TX1
    TX1 --> TX2
    TX2 --> TX3
    TX3 -- No --> TX4
    TX3 -- Yes --> TX5
``` 

As the diagram shown above, Rx (Receive) and Tx (Transmit) are the 2 most important traits introduced in Starberry 0.6. All of the protocols are wrapped with them. 

This means that you will be able to define your own protocol in App, and very soon you will be able to use socket and ftp in starberry. Currently Http and Sql has been implemented 

For example, you may send an Http request by 

(1) Building a connection with the server 

```rust
let builder = ConnectionBuilder::new("example.com", 443)
    .protocol(Protocol::HTTP)
    .tls(true);
let connection = builder.connect().await.unwrap(); 
``` 

(2) Create a new Tx (HttpResCtx is the struct implemented Tx in Http) 

```rust 
let mut request = HttpResCtx::new(connection, "example.com"); 
``` 

(3) Insert the request by using the `Tx::prcess()` function 

```rust 
let _ = request.process(request_templates::get_request("/")).await; 
``` 

Because we need to borrow the reader from the HttpResCtx so we didn't use the &mut Response from the process() function, we directly use HttpReqCtx.response to further process 

```rust 
request.response.parse_body(
    &mut request.reader,
    1024 * 1024,
).await;
println!("{:?}, {:?}", request.response.meta, request.response.body); 
``` 

### Protocol Registry 

Protocol registry now manages middleware chains and handler registration through a unified API 

The `App` type no longer owns a global `Url` tree or middleware list. 

URLs and middleware must now be configured on the **protocol** level during protocol registration. 

You

```rust 
pub static APP: SApp = once_cell::sync::Lazy::new(|| {
    App::new() 
        .protocol(HandlerBuilder::new()
            .protocol(ProtocolBuilder::<HttpReqCtx>::new()) 
            // .protocol(ProtocolBuilder:: /* .. /* ) <- Add another protocol 
            .build() 
        )
        .build() 
}); 
``` 

### Argumented URLs 

Two new kinds of url has been introduced in the 0.5 version, which is `PatUrl` and `ArgUrl`. 

Both of them support aliasing url, and you may use the given name to look for them. This solves the problem of we can only get the url segment by inputting index in `HttpReqCtx::get_path()`. We may insert the name in `HttpReqCtx::get_arg()` to look for it 

### Sql support 

### Unify Http Request and Http Response 

You may see in the new Http mod, request and responses are in the same structure of 

```rust 
pub struct HttpRequest {
    pub meta: HttpMeta,
    pub body: HttpBody
}

pub struct HttpResponse { 
    pub meta: HttpMeta, 
    pub body: HttpBody 
}  
``` 

Where `HttpMeta` and `HttpBody` both implemented different methods for sending/parsing request/response 

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Installation

Install starberry bu using 

```
cargo install starberry 
``` 

After installing starberry, use 

```
starberry new <Proj_name> 
``` 

To create a new project 

### Quick Start

```rust
use starberry::prelude::*; 

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    APP.clone().run().await;
}

pub static APP: SApp = Lazy::new(|| {
    App::new().build()
});

#[lit_url(APP, "/")]
async fn home_route() -> HttpResponse {
    text_response("Hello, world!")
}
```

Visit your server at `http://localhost:3003`

### Project Structure

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... 
â”œâ”€â”€ programfiles/ 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.json 
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... 
â””â”€â”€ templates/
    â”œâ”€â”€ base.html
    â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
    â””â”€â”€ ... 
``` 

Program file folder is used to store the config of the program data generated during the process of running the program. The files are automatically copied to the `dist` directory when you run `starberry build`. 

Templates are automatically copied to the `dist` directory when you run `starberry build`.
